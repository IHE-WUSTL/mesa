<h1><a name="#intro" id="#intro">Introduction</a> </h1>
<p>The MESA tests include a number of cases each of  which rely on a sequence of messages between actors. These tests range across  different integration profiles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Retrieve  Information for Display</li>
  <li>Enterprise User Authentication</li>
  <li>Patient  Identity Cross Reference for MPI</li>
  <li>Patient  Synchronized Application</li>
  <li>Consistent  Time</li>
</ul>
<p>This document lists the  transactions and messages for a number of cases. It may not describe the  clinical scenario behind each case, but listing the transactions should clearly  define what is expected of each actor.&nbsp;  These are all of the transactions involving all of the actors.&nbsp; When you test with your particular actor, you  may see only a subset of these messages.</p>
<h2><a name="#patient_id" id="#patient_id">Patient Identification</a> </h2>
<h2><a name="#sub_results" id="#sub_results">Submission of Results</a></h2>
<p>Test descriptions  below inform the reader to &ldquo;submit results to the Project Manager&rdquo;. This is  does not mean &ldquo;email&rdquo;. The current submission process should be documented by  the Project Manager, but will not include emailing files directly to the  Project Manager.</p>

<h1>&nbsp;<a name="#test_cases_eua" id="#test_cases_eua">Test Cases: EUA</a></h1>
<p>This section describes test cases that are generally  associated with the EUA Integration Profile. There may be some overlap with  other profiles.<br />
  Each test case involves a series of transactions involving  one test patient.&nbsp; Some patients may  require that a single actor participate in multiple transactions. The tables in  this section give the order of messages for an integrated system with all  actors.&nbsp; This is provided as a  centralized reference.&nbsp; To test an  individual IHE actor, refer to the appropriate test document.</p>

<h2><a name="#test_10301" id="#test_10301">Test Case 10301: EUA Kerberos  Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Test case 10301 covers the EUA Kerberos Authentication. A  user &ldquo;logs-in&rdquo; to a client computer using Kerberos authentication with a  Kerberos Authentication Server.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>ITI TF-2: 3.2</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>This test does not involve any MESA software. The intent of this test is for  your system to properly authenticate users on another system.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Configure  your Kerberos Authentication Server. We have a separate document (<em>Kerberos  Notes</em>) with notes about how to do this.</li>
  <li>Create  an account entry on the authentication server with the name &ldquo;khimss&rdquo;. Set the  password to something of your choosing.</li>
  <li>Obtain  a Unix (Unix or Linux) system to act as the client computer. We use Red Hat  Linux 9.0 for this task with appropriate notes in Kerberos Notes. Configure the  Unix system to use Kerberos authentication with your Kerberos Authentication  Server.</li>
  <li>Logout from the  client Unix system. Unplug the network adapter of that system so it cannot  reach the Kerberos Authentication Server. Try to login to the Unix computer  using the khimss account and password. If this is successful, it indicates you  are not authenticating with the Kerberos Authentication Server; check your  configuration and try again.</li>
  <li>Reconnect  the Unix system to your local network. Login to this computer using the khimss  account and password you selected.</li>
  <li>From  a terminal emulator, run the command klist. This should print ticket  information for your account. Redirect the output to the text file <em>grade_10301.txt</em>:</li>
</ol>
<pre>       klist  &gt; grade_10301.txt</pre>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Email the grade file to the Project  Manager.
      </p>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>The goal of this test is to make sure you know how to  configure your computer system to use Kerberos authentication and that you have  tested that in your lab. No further testing of Kerberized communication is  required.</p>
