<h1><a name="#intro" id="#intro">Introduction</a> </h1>
<p>The MESA tests include a number of cases each of  which rely on a sequence of messages between actors. These tests range across  different integration profiles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Retrieve  Information for Display</li>
  <li>Enterprise User Authentication</li>
  <li>Patient  Identity Cross Reference for MPI</li>
  <li>Patient  Synchronized Application</li>
  <li>Consistent  Time</li>
</ul>
<p>This document lists the  transactions and messages for a number of cases. It may not describe the  clinical scenario behind each case, but listing the transactions should clearly  define what is expected of each actor.&nbsp;  These are all of the transactions involving all of the actors.&nbsp; When you test with your particular actor, you  may see only a subset of these messages.</p>
<h2><a name="#patient_id" id="#patient_id">Patient Identification</a> </h2>

<h1><a name="#test_cases_rid" id="#test_cases_rid">Test Cases: RID</a></h1>
<p>This section  describes test cases that are generally associated with the RID Integration  Profile. There may be some overlap with other profiles.<br />
  Each test case  involves a series of transactions involving one test patient.&nbsp; Some patients may require that a single actor  participate in multiple transactions. The tables in this section give the order  of messages for an integrated system with all actors.&nbsp; This is provided as a centralized  reference.&nbsp; To test an individual IHE  actor, refer to the appropriate test document.</p>

<h2><a name="#test_10301" id="#test_10301">Test Case 10301: EUA Kerberos  Authentication</a></h2>
<p>Test case 10301 covers the EUA Kerberos Authentication. A  user &ldquo;logs-in&rdquo; to a client computer using Kerberos authentication with a  Kerberos Authentication Server.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<p>ITI TF-2: 3.2</p>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>This test does not involve any MESA software. The intent of this test is for  your computer system to support a user login with name/password authentication  managed by a Kerberos Authentication Server.</p>
<h4>UNIX Workstation Instructions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Create  a Kerberos Authentication Server. We have a separate document (<em>Kerberos  Notes</em>) with notes about how to do this. We imagine most people will create  this server using Windows 2000 Server, but that is not a requirement.</li>
  <li>Create  an account entry on the authentication server with the name &ldquo;khimss&rdquo;. Set the  password to something of your choosing.</li>
  <li>Configure  your client system to use Kerberos authentication with the Kerberose  Authentication Server. Your client computer should not use local password  verification (see our document <em>Kerberos Notes</em>.</li>
  <li>Logout from your  client system. Unplug the network adapter of that system so it cannot reach the  Kerberos Authentication Server. Try to login to your computer using the khimss  account and password. If this is successful, it indicates you are not authenticating  with the Kerberos Authentication Server; check your configuration and try  again.</li>
  <li>Reconnect  your client system to your local network. Login to your computer using the  khimss account and password you selected.</li>
  <li>From  a terminal emulator, run the command klist. This should print ticket  information for your account. Redirect the output to the text file <em>grade_10301.txt</em>:</li>
</ol>
<pre>       klist  &gt; grade_10301.txt</pre>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Email the grade file to the Project  Manager.
      </p>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Windows Workstation Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Create  a Kerberos Authentication Server. We have a separate document (<em>Kerberos  Notes</em>) with notes about how to do this. We imagine most people will create  this server using Windows 2000 Server. On the Authentication Server, create a  domain called HIMSS.</li>
    <li>Create  an account entry on the authentication server with the name &ldquo;khimss&rdquo;. Set the  password to something of your choosing.</li>
    <li>Configure  your client system to use Kerberos authentication with the Kerberose  Authentication Server. (Domain name is HIMSS).Your client computer should not  use local password verification (see our document <em>Kerberos Notes</em>.</li>
    <li>Logout from your  client system. Unplug the network adapter of that system so it cannot reach the  Kerberos Authentication Server. Try to login to your computer using the khimss  account and password. If this is successful, it indicates you are not  authenticating with the Kerberos Authentication Server; check your  configuration and try again.</li>
    <li>Reconnect  your client system to your local network. The login screen should allow you to  choose a domain. Based on step 1 above, the domain HIMSS should be available.  Use a camera (preferably digital) to take a photograph of the login screen  showing the HIMSS domain. Submit/email the photograph to the Project Manager.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Login to your computer using the khimss account  and password you selected.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>The goal of this test is to make sure you know how to  configure your computer system to use Kerberos authentication and that you have  tested that in your lab. No further testing of Kerberized communication is  required.</p>
