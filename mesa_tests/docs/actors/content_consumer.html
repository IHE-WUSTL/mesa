<h2><a name="#intro" id="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The MESA tests include a number of cases each of  which rely on a sequence of messages between actors. These tests range across  different integration profiles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>XDS-MS</li>
  <li>XDS-SD</li>
  <li>PPHP</li>
  <li>EDR</li>
  <li>BPPC</li>
  <li>XPHR</li>
  <li>XD*-Lab</li>
</ul>
<p>This document lists the  transactions and messages for a number of cases. It may not describe the  clinical scenario behind each case, but listing the transactions should clearly  define what is expected of each actor.&nbsp;  These are all of the transactions involving all of the actors.&nbsp; When you test with your particular actor, you  may see only a subset of these messages.</p>
<p>Note that the tests for Content profiles such as XDS-MS  and XDS-SD  are over and above tests for the delivery of data for profiles XDS, XDM and XDR. The tests described in this  document concern the content described in the XDS-MS and XDS-SD profile. The XDS/XDM/XDR tests  concerned with delivery of data are documented elsewhere.</p>

        <p>In test 14121, the Document Consumer renders a PDF/A and a plaintext document and submits the two screen shots to the Project Manager for evaluation. The  purpose of this test is to make sure the consumer application can properly render the XDS-SD document.</p>
        <h3>References</h3>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>The  file<em> $MESA_TARGET/mesa_tests/iti/msgs/xds-sd/example1.xml </em>represents a sample  CDA-wrapped PDF/A document according to the XDS-SD Integration Profile. <em><br />
              <br />
          $MESA_TARGET/mesa_tests/iti/msgs/xds-sd/example2.xml </em>is CDA-wrapped plaintext. <br />
        <br />
        Import these 2 documents  into your system by out of band means (the MESA tests do not give you a Document  Repository that allows you to retrieve this document).        <br />
        <br />
        </li>
          <li>Render  the content on your system.<br />
            <br />

          <li>Perform  a screen capture of the rendered output. Name the captured output <em>&lt;your-system-name&gt;_14121_pdf.&lt;extension&gt;</em>  and <em>&lt;your-system-name&gt;_14121_text.&lt;extension&gt;</em> where &lt;extension&gt; is html, jpg, bmp, doc, etc.</li>

<p>The Document Consumer will import a number of documents  supplied by different XDS-SD Document Sources. The Document Consumer fills out a  worksheet indicating if the content could be imported/rendered.<br />
  The purpose of this test is to give Document Consumers a  chance to examine content in advance of a face to face test. This will allow  some debugging of document content to be performed offline rather than in real  time.</p>
<h3>References</h3>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Look  on the MESA Software Distribution web page for the file: <em>xds-sd-14101.zip</em>. This  file contains CDA documents from Document Source actors and a Word document  that is a worksheet to complete.</li>
  <li>Import/render  each CDA-wrapped document in the zip file.</li>
  <li>For  each document, fill out the appropriate data in the worksheet.</li>
  <li>Name  the worksheet: <em>&lt;your-system-name&gt;_14101.xls</em></li>
</ol>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Submit the worksheet created above to the Project  Manager for evaluation.</li>
  <li>If you find any documents that are problematic, contact  the Project Manager as soon as possible so we can work with the source of the  data.</li>
