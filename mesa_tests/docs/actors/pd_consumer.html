<h2><a name="#patient_id" id="#patient_id">Patient Identification</a> </h2>
<p>Patient IDs are  assigned to test specific features of the PDQ profile. The values used for  Assigning Authority in PID.3 are taken from the HIMSS 2005 demonstrations. The  values work equally well for test cases. The values for assigning authority are  listed in the table below.<br />
  Note that the use  of OIDs replaces simple assigning authority names used in other MESA tests.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<h2><a name="#config" id="#config">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>The MESA scripts are run from  the directory <em>$MESA_TARGET/mesa_tests/iti/actors/pd_consumer</em>. The ASCII  configuration file <em>pd_consumer.cfg</em> contains parameters that configure  the MESA Patient Demographics Supplier. The default port number is 3700. You  should only change this port number if there is a conflict with another service  on the MESA  test computer. There will be no conflicts with other MESA servers; the only conflict would occur  with something from the operating system or other software package.<br />
  You should  configure your Patient Demographics Conumer to send HL7 query messages to the  MESA Cross Reference Manager listening on port 3700. HL7 communication uses TCP  sockets and the minimal lower level protocol.<br />
  For testing the  PAM profile, the Patient Demographics Consumer is expected to have an HL7  server that accepts ADT messages. The pd_consumer.cfg file lists entries for  the server as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p>Modify the text  file as appropriate to designate the system under test.</p>

<h2><a name="#start_servers" id="#start_servers">Starting the </a>MESA Servers</h2>
<p>MESA servers are started from a DOS/CMD  window or a terminal emulator. Follow these steps for Unix systems</p>
<ol>
  <pre><li>cd  $MESA_TARGET/mesa_tests/iti/actors/pd_consumer</li></pre>
  <pre><li>scripts/start_mesa_servers.csh</li></pre>
</ol>
<p>To stop the  servers:
<pre>     scripts/stop_mesa_servers.csh</pre>
  The start  instructions for MESA  tools on a Windows system are:</p>
<ol>
  <pre><li>cd %MESA_TARGET%\mesa_tests\iti\actors\pd_consumer</li></pre>
  <pre><li>scripts\start_mesa_servers.bat</li></pre>
</ol>
<p>To stop the MESA servers:<br />
  Kill the server  using ^C in the same DOS window where you started the server. When you started  the server, it ran the server in the foreground.</p>
<h2><a name="#inst_test" id="#inst_test">Installation Test</a> </h2>
<h2><a name="#load_mesa" id="#load_mesa">Loading </a>MESA PD Supplier</h2>
<p>The MESA PD  supplier needs demographic records loaded to support the PD Consumer under  test. After the MESA  servers are running, the PD Supplier is loaded as follows:
<pre>     perl scripts/pdc_pdq.pl 11300 1 x</pre>
  This is a one  time setup that should be run before the first test. It does not have to be run  in between tests.</p>
<h2><a name="#sub_results" id="#sub_results">Submission of Results</a></h2>
<p>Test descriptions  below inform the reader to &ldquo;submit results to the Project Manager&rdquo;. This is  does not mean &ldquo;email&rdquo;. The current submission process should be documented by  the Project Manager, but will not include emailing files directly to the  Project Manager.</p>

<h1><a name="#test_cases_pdq" id="#test_cases_pdq">Test Cases: PDQ</a></h1>
 <p>This section describes test cases that are generally  associated with the PDQ
    Integration Profile. There may be some overlap with  other profiles.</p>

 <h2><a name="#test_11311" id="#test_11311">Test Case 11311: Exact Name Search</a> </h2>
  <p>Test case 11311 covers an exact name search by the Patient Demographics
     Consumer.</p>
  <p>Several ADT messages are sent to the Patient Demographics  Supplier. Then, the
     PD Consumer sends a query. The consumer is expected to query by exact patient
	 name. QPD-1 (Message Query Name) is a field that the Supplier  needs to be able
	 to configure on a site specific basis. For these tests, use the value listed in the
	 table below (taken from ITI CP 170). </p>
  
  <table align="center" border="2" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">

  </table>

  <p>If populated, field RCP-2 should contain the value 10^RD or  a higher number.
     This will allow a response with all records. There are later  tests for limiting
	 the number of records in a response.</p>
  <h4>What if my application does not make this query?</h4>
  <p>The PDQ profile does not demand specific queries of consumers. If this is not a natural query for your application, submit a note (.txt file) that briefly explains why your system would not make this query and list queries that your system does make. </p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>To run this test, follow these steps using a DOS window or  terminal emulator:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set  the current directory to <em>$MESA_TARGET/mesa_tests/iti/actors/pd_consumer</em>.</li>
  <li>The  file <em>pd_consumer.cfg</em> describes the MESA  servers for this test. You should be aware of this file but should not modify  it unless you have problems starting the MESA  servers.</li>
  <li>Make  sure the MESA  servers have been started. See <a href="#start_servers">Starting the MESA Servers</a> for details.</li>
  <li>Load  the MESA PD Supplier with data as described in <a href="#load_mesa">Loading MESA PD Supplier</a> (if not already  done).</li>
  <li>Run  the test script as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre>     perl  scripts/pdc_pdq.pl 11311 &lt;log level&gt;</pre>
  <blockquote>
    <p>where &lt;log level&gt; is a  value between 1 and 4.</p>

  <li>Submit  the grade file at log level 4 to the Project Manager. The Project Manager may examine the file  and require you to modify your query and/or to perform additional queries.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Supplemental Information </h3>
<ol>
  <li>The  evaluation script takes a single argument, &lt;log level&gt;. When debugging  output, it is sometimes helpful to use a log level of 1 to see only  differences. When submitting results, we prefer the output with the most  verbose level, 4.</li>
  <li>If  you want to see a query generated by a MESA PD Consumer, run test 11311 in self  test mode. Then run the evaluation as above and examine the grade file. To run  in self test mode:</li>

  <h4>Field RCP-2 should contain the value 1^RD to indicate one  record per response.</h4>

   <p>The evaluation script will examine your query, but will not  examine the
      intermediate and subsequent queries sent by your system. If you do  not send the
	  proper continuation data, the MESA  server will not respond and will log information
	  in the MESA log messages.</p>
   <h4>What if my application does not suppoprt incremental queries?</h4>
   <p>You should consider implementing this for your product. This will result in a
      much more robust and responsive product. </p>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
   <p>To run this test, follow these steps using a DOS window or  terminal emulator:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Set  the current directory to $MESA_TARGET/mesa_tests/iti/actors/pd_consumer.</li>
    <li>The file <em>pd_consumer.cfg</em> describes the MESA  servers for this test.
	    You should be aware of this file but should not modify  it unless you have problems
		starting the MESA  servers.</li>
    <li>Make sure the MESA  servers have been started. See
	    <a href="#start_servers">Starting the MESA Servers</a> for details.</li>
    <li>Load the MESA PD Supplier with data as described in
	     <a href="#load_mesa">Loading MESA PD Supplier</a> (if not already  done).</li>
    <li>Run  the test script as follows:</li>
   </ol>
   <pre>     perl  scripts/pdc_pdq.pl 11365 &lt;log level&gt;</pre>
   <blockquote>
     <p>where &lt;log level&gt; is a  value between 1 and 4. </p>
   </blockquote>
   <ol start="6">
    <li>The test script will send several A04 registration messages to the MESA Patient
	    Demgraphics Supplier. After the A04 messages, your system is prompted to send
		one Patient Demographics Query.</li>
   </ol>
  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
   <p>To evaluate your response to this test:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Run  the evaluation script</li>
   </ol>
   <pre>     perl  11365/eval_11365.pl </pre>
   <ol start="2">
    <li>The  output file is 11365/grade_11365.txt. This test is successfully completed
	    when the last line in the output file indicates 0 errors.</li>
   <li>Submit the grade file at log level 4 to the Project Manager. The Project
       Manager may examine the  file  and require you to modify your query and/or to
	   perform additional queries.</li>
   </ol>
  <h3>Supplemental Information </h3>
   <ol>
    <li>If you want to see a query generated by a MESA PD Consumer, run test 11365 in
	    self test mode. Then run the evaluation as above and examine the grade file.
		To run in self test mode:</li>
