  <h2><a name="#intro" id="#intro">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>This document describes tests for two  grayscale monitor mammography workstations which are Image Display actors in the Mammography Image  Profile. The Display Consistency tests are defined in a separate document: <em>Display Consistency Test Plan for Image  Displays</em>.</p>
<p align="center"><span class="style1">MIR gratefully acknowledges the contribution of David Clunie to this test plan. <br />
These tests and the accomanying dataset were created by David and used<br />
at the North American Connectathon in January 2006.  They have<br />
merely been reformatted in MESA test plan style in this document.
<br />
<br />
Not all of these tests will be required for MESA testing; however, vendors <br />
are encouraged to exercise their system by running of as many as possible.<br />
<br />
Consult the Kudu webtool for the list of required tests for your Image Display actor<br />
to be submitted for MESA test results. The remaining tests are candidates<br />
for Connectathon 2007 testing.

  <h2><a name="#start_servers" id="#start_servers">Starting the </a>MESA Servers </h2>
  <p>These instructions assume you are using a terminal  emulator on Unix systems or an MS DOS command window under Windows.&nbsp; Each test uses a command line interface;  there is no graphical user interface. &nbsp;Before  you start the test procedure, you need to start the MESA Image Manager  servers.&nbsp; Make sure the appropriate  database is running (PostgreSQL, SQL Server).&nbsp;  To start the MESA  servers:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Enter       the Image Display exam folder:<em> mesa_tests/rad/actors/imgdisp</em></li>
    <li>Execute       the appropriate script to start the servers:</li>
  </ol>
  <pre>     scripts/start_mesa_servers.csh &nbsp;(Unix)</pre>
    <pre>     scripts\start_mesa_servers.bat  (Windows)</pre>
    Log levels are set for the MESA Image Manager in the file: <em>$MESA_TARGET/runtime/imgmgr/ds_dcm.cfg</em>.&nbsp; Log levels are:</p>
  <ol start="0">
    <li>no logging</li>
    <li>errors</li>
    <li>warnings</li>
    <li>verbose</li>
    <li>conversational  (really verbose)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When you are finished running one or more tests, you can  stop the servers:
<pre>     scripts/stop_mesa_servers.csh  (Unix)</pre>
    <pre>     scripts\stop_mesa_servers.bat  (Windows)</pre>
    Log files are stored in <em>$MESA_TARGET/logs</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="#app" id="#app"></a>Appendix A </h2>
<p>This appendix contains David Clunie&rsquo;s additional notes on  the datasets he assembled and which are used in these tests.&nbsp; <br />
  These notes are informative to both the executors and  evaluators of these tests.</p>
<h2><a name="#dataset_00100n" id="#dataset_00100n">Dataset 00100n Notes</a></h2>
<p>This dataset is derived from images of the same woman with  sensors from different vendors, but edited in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replace the dates such that two test sets are  derived from each vendor pair, with the current and prior sets swapped, in  order to test scaling in both directions (i.e. that a smaller pixel size on the  prior study works as well as a larger pixel size on the prior study)</li>
  <li>Any look up tables (VOI LUT Sequence items) have  been burned in to the pixel data followed by specification of an identity  lookup table transformation, in order to remove this as a confounding factor to  reviewers evaluating the appearance &hellip; this set of test cases is specifically  not testing windowing and LUT function</li>
  <li>Images from the vendors sensor that are not  already &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; horizontally into the expected hanging orientation have not  been flipped, but their Patient Orientation attributes have been confirmed to  be correct; that is, the test case tests whether or not the Image Display  correctly flips the images.</li>
  <li>Although some images have been used multiple  times in different test sets (e.g., the swapped current and prior pairs),  different Patient IDs, Study IDs, and UIDs have been assigned, so all the test  images may co-exist simultaneously without interfering with each other in the  same system.</li>
  <li>All attributes that were encoded in the vendor&rsquo;s  original images, other than those required to be present, or have values, by  the DICOM Standard and by the IHE Profile, have been removed. This includes not  only removal of private attributes, but also attributes and values specified as  optional in the Digital Mammography Image IOD but not required by the IHE  Profile, as well as any Standard Extended attributes added by the vendor.  Further, any attributes or values required by the DICOM Standard or the IHE  Profile that were not present have been added with appropriate values. The  rational for this is that the test is a test of the IHE Profile, not the  Acquisition Modality vendor&rsquo;s implementation, and hence the behavior of the  Image Display should depend only on those attributes specified by the IHE  Profile.</li>
  <li>Though the set of attributes required to test  for correct annotation are included in the images in this test case, that is  not a specific purpose of this test case, with the exception of the zoom factor  to indicate the degree of magnification or minification</li>
  <li>As a consequence of the choice of the  Acquisition Modality vendor, some images are grouped one view per series, and  others all together in the same series &ndash; no attempt has been made to re-group  these one way or the other, so this test also serves to address the ability of  the Image Display to essentially ignore the series organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="#dataset_004001-2" id="#dataset_004001-2">Dataset 004001-2 Notes</a></h2>

  <li>The images are of the same phantom with  different sensors from different vendors, such that a variable matrix size  (number of rows and columns) and variable pixel spacing is used.</li>
  <li>Presumably due to differences in the geometry of  the acquisition devices and hence geometric magnification, or differing interpretation  of the meaning of &ldquo;front of the receptor housing&rdquo;, there are slight deviations  in the Imager Pixel Spacing and Estimated Radiographic Magnification Factor  attributes from the ideal value expected from the actual ruler size, and this  manifests itself as differences in apparent size of the phantom when supposedly  scaled identically, and differences in measurements of the ruler size &ndash; example  distance measurements of the horizontal and vertical 100mm rulers on a sample  Image Display are as follows:</li>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>RMLO: vertical 105.0 mm horizontal 103.6 mm</li>
      <li>LMLO: vertical 101.7 mm horizontal 100.4 mm</li>
      <li>RCC: vertical 98.4 mm horizontal 98.0 mm</li>
      <li>LCC: vertical 103.7 mm horizontal 104.0 mm</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>The images are already orientated correctly.</li>
  <li>Window values appropriate to each image are  present, but some manually windowing is likely to be required to match the  appearance of adjacent images.</li>
  <li>Regardless of whether the images are displayed  scaled to fit the largest breast or at true size, or at any specific size, all  four views will likely be displayed with different zoom factors relative to  encoded pixel size, since the encoded pixel spacing varies between the images.</li>
  <li>Failure will typically manifest itself by  phantoms that do not appear to be of the same size, cannot be scaled to true  size, or distance measurements of the rulers that exceed the specified  tolerances for the test.</li>

  <li>Apart from failure to display the required  Clinical, Investigative and Technique annotations, an additional failure mode  for this test is the inability to display values from View Code Sequence  Modifier, and in particular, multiple values of that Sequence, which in this  case include codes for both spot compression and magnification, and to display  them with the correct abbreviation (not to be confused with any burned in  abbreviation or lead markers inserted by the acquisition modality or operator).</li>
  <li>The acquisition date and time are deliberately  different from the study date and time, in order to be sure that the  acquisition values, not the study values, are annotated on the image.</li>

  <li>The L MLO image contains the contrast  transformation burned in to the pixel data and an identifty transformation for  the 12 bit pixel data (width of 4096 and center of 2048), in addition to a VOI  LUT Shape value of LINEAR; however, if the Image Display ignores the VOI LUT  Shape and applies an (additional) sigmoid transformation, then the contrast  appearance will be slightly different from that intended, but still relatively  close to that of the LUT applied to the R MLO, and not as dramatically  different as if the LUT is not applied.</li>
  <li>The secondary capture replica of the burned in  LUT L MLO is provided in case this helps circumvent the sigmoid versus linear  interpretation of the identity window transformation.</li>
  <li>The LUT used is one containing a sigmoid curve  shape as created by a GE Acquisition Modality</li>
  <li>Failure to apply the LUT will result in the two  displayed views having a noticeably different appearance in the light and dark  areas.</li>

  <li>This test works by specifying a text message  with the word PASS that has a pixel value just below the grayscale values that  would be selected for display if the window center and width are interpreted  with a linear function, rather than the sigmoid function requested by the VOI  LUT Function attribute value in the image.</li>

  <li>Pixel padding values are used that are other  than 0, since Image Displays may handle zero values specially already, yet the  profile and the standard require that the value specified in Pixel Padding  Value be used.</li>
  <li>A high pixel padding value is tested in addition  to a low pixel padding value, since and Image Display may handle low values  other than zero specially, and further, the choice of a high pixel padding  value may interfere with interpolation when an image is magnified or minified,  which will manifest as a solid or interrupted white line at the edge of the  suppressed air area, since high pixel values (intended to be suppressed) may be  averaged with adjacent genuine dark pixel values, causing them to be displayed  with artificially high intensity. The lesson being that high pixel padding  values are a bad idea, and that pixel padding values should ideally be converted  into a mask that is scaled and then applied after the genuine image pixel  values have been scaled</li>
  <li>Failure to detect and apply the Pixel Padding  Value will result in the air outside the breast increasing in intensity with  windowing and as white when inverted.</li>

  <li>A single CAD object is present in this test set,  which contains marks applicable to two images; this is as encoded by the CAD  vendor, except that it has been de-identified.</li>
  <li>The CAD object contains single image findings,  some of which have a rendering intent that is required, and others with a  rendering intent that is optional; whether or not to display the optional marks  is at the discretion of the Image Display, and is not a requirement for success  for this test.</li>
  <li>The CAD object contains references to the For  Processing images, which are not actually present in the test set. The Image  Display must resolve the references using the Source Image Sequence in the For  Presentation images; note that the Spatial Relationships Preserved attribute is  present in the Source Image Sequence and has a value of YES.</li>
